# 2020MortalityProject

Messing around with Vital Statistics data from 2020

At some point, I was bored and wanted to brush up on my R skills since I had been working in SAS for my job. I thought it might be interesting to explore some of
the US Multiple Cause of Death Mortality files from the National Vital Statistics System/National Center for Health Statistics. So, I downloaded the 2020 US Deaths
file to see what I could see.

I ended up getting busy with other analyses for work and moving and dropped this project, but here is the cleaning/data exploration file anyway.
